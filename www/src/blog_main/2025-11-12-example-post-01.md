## Introduction

Modern web development has evolved significantly over the past few years. With new frameworks, tools, and best practices emerging constantly, it can be overwhelming for newcomers to know where to start.

In this article, you'll learn:
- The core technologies that power the web
- Essential tools every developer should know
- Best practices for starting your web development journey

## The Foundation: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Every website is built on three fundamental technologies:

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** provides the structure and content of web pages. It defines headings, paragraphs, links, images, and all other elements you see on a page.

**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** handles the visual presentation. It controls colors, layouts, fonts, animations, and makes websites look beautiful and responsive.

**JavaScript** adds interactivity and dynamic behavior. It enables features like form validation, interactive maps, real-time updates, and much more.

## Modern Development Tools

Today's developers rely on several essential tools:

### Code Editors

Popular choices include:
- Visual Studio Code (most popular)
- Sublime Text
- WebStorm

### Version Control

Git is the industry standard for tracking code changes and collaborating with others. GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket provide hosting for Git repositories.

### Package Managers

npm (Node Package Manager) and yarn help you install and manage libraries and dependencies in your projects.

## Best Practices for Beginners

1. **Start with the basics**: Master HTML and CSS before jumping into JavaScript frameworks
2. **Build projects**: Learning by doing is more effective than tutorials alone
3. **Read documentation**: Official docs are your best resource
4. **Join communities**: Connect with other developers on forums and Discord servers

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Jumping to frameworks too quickly**: Learn vanilla JavaScript first
- **Not using version control**: Start using Git from day one
- **Copying code without understanding**: Always understand what your code does
- **Perfectionism**: Your first projects don't need to be perfect

## Conclusion

Web development is an exciting and rewarding field. Start with the fundamentals, practice regularly, and don't be afraid to make mistakes.

Key takeaways:
- Master HTML, CSS, and JavaScript first
- Use proper tools from the beginning
- Build real projects to learn effectively
- Connect with the developer community

Happy coding!
