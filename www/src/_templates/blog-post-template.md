## Background / Context

Provide necessary context or background information. Why is this topic important? What should readers know before diving in?

This section helps set the stage for the main content.

## Main Content Section 1

Break your article into logical sections with clear headings. Each section should cover one main idea or step.

### Subsection Example

You can use subsections to organize content further.

```javascript
// Include code examples when relevant
function exampleFunction() {
    console.log("Make sure your code is well-commented");
    return "Keep examples concise and practical";
}
```

Explain what the code does and why it matters.

## Main Content Section 2

Continue building on your topic. Use:
